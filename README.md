# Tama the Tamagotchi
For this game, we are going back to play one of the hottest games of the late 1990's early 2000. Tama the Tamagotchi is a silly little dinosaur who wants to have his needs met. He enjoys a good snack, some naps and a few toys. Help keep Tama happy by giving him what he needs. 

# The Game
Start the game by pressing "GO", once the button is clicked you will see a message displayed by Tama. Use the button key on top of the page to decide what Tama needs then press the button inside the Tamagotchi to respond to Tama. After a need has been met you will see a message from Tama, if the wrong need is met you will see a "try again." Once you see a message press "GO" for a new message. 

Once a need has been met you will see your points go up. If the points reach 5, you win and you can press "play again" to restart the game. If you give Tama the wrong items, your points will go down. If the points reach 0, you lose. You can press "play again" to restart the game.
